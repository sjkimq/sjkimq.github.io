# Shared Autonomy and Work

- What does shared autonomy actually look like?

- robots perform difficult and dangerous tasks 

- In classical robotics
  - very clear seperation between the workspace of robots and where humans would operate 
- Now
  - workspace is becoming blended 
  - that brings new challenges 


- Business perspective
  - don't tire
  - don't go on holiday
  - don't call in sick
  - saving a lot of money

- seen from employees perspective
  - robots does job twices as good and half the time

- next 10 years
  - 80% jobs in America are going to be partly or fully automated
  - not just talking about blue color but also white color jobs


- ideal outcome
  - have robotics and humans working tandem in the sense of shared autonomy

- new paradigm
  - equipping people with new tools 
    - humans are very good at 
      - cognitive decision making
      - contextualizing
    - robots are very good at
      - repeated powerful actions
  - human decision making and precision power and accuracy of robotics

- risk
  - de-skilling
    - self-driving car taking over decision-making
    - might de-learn how to drive properly
  - memorize cell phone numbers 
  - rely on spell correction
  - navigate through the streets
