# Shared Autonomy for Robots in Dynamic Environments

- Robot operations
  - Teleoperation
    - Traditionally robots operated using concepts of teleoperation
    - past 50, 60 years
    - kinesthetic demonstrations or programming methods
  - Shared Autonomy
    - challenge in the next 10 to 15 years
    - even within a single task
      - seamlessly move between significant autonomous behaviors to large amounts of human input and human teleoperation
  - Autonomy

- Two extremes
  - scenarios where we want to reduce cognitive load and the people operating the systems by increasing autonomy
  - but at the same time, we want to make sure human input is taken into account while ensuring that we're doing the right kind of things.


- Shared autunomy need to take into account user intentions
  - need to take into account adversarial and cooperative behaviors 
  - as well as need to take into account scenarios where forces from two different agents are interacting on the same device.

## Reasons that robotics challenging now
- Full autonomy in waiting for full autonomous behaviors is going to be a big challenge
- Full-autonomy challenges due to:
  - Robots closely interact with multiple objects
  - Noisy sensing with ambiguity
  - Hard to model dynamics
  - Need guarantees for safe operations for robots
  - Highly constrained environment
  - Un-modelled user intentions in constrained environments

## Shared Autonomy for Remote Operations
- Shared autonomy or remote operation with assisted teleoperation and autonomous behaviours
- No line of sight - depth sensing, laser, situational awareness cameras
- High performance compression and networking with fail safety
